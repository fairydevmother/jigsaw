      "description": "Creating a web application with next.js technology",
      "preview": "Techies, buckle up your seat belts, because we're about to embark on a wild ride of creating a Next.js web application! But before we dive into the coding, let's talk about what exactly is Next.js and why it's the superhero of the web development world.",
      "body": "Next.js is a React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically exported web applications. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create fast and efficient web applications, and it does so by handling a lot of the underlying complexities for you. \n So why do we use Next.js, you ask? Well, there are several reasons: \n 1) Server-side rendering: Next.js allows you to render your pages on the server, which means your pages load faster and have better SEO. This is especially important for sites with a lot of content that can take a while to load. \n 2) Easy-to-use: Next.js makes it easy for developers to create and deploy web applications. It has a great CLI tool that can help you get started quickly and it has a lot of built-in features that make your life as a developer easier. \n 3) Good for SEO: Next.js is designed with SEO in mind, which means it can help your site rank higher in search results. This is important for sites that rely on organic traffic. \n 4) Scalable: Next.js is designed to be scalable, which means you can use it to build large and complex web applications. It's also designed to be fast, which means your users won't have to wait for your site to load. \n Now that we've covered the basics of Next.js, let's dive into creating our Next.js web application! \n First of all, let's take a moment to celebrate the fact that you're now officially a full-stack developer (or in the process of becoming one). That's pretty impressive, and I'm sure you're already wearing a cape under your shirt (if not, I highly recommend it). \n Okay, now that we have that out of the way, let's get to the fun part. The first step in creating a Next.js web application is to get your hands on a computer that can handle all that coding power you're about to unleash. I recommend a computer with at least 16GB of RAM and a graphics card that's powerful enough to run the Matrix. \n Once you've got your computer all set up, it's time to install Node.js, which is the backbone of your Next.js application. Trust me, Node.js is like the Wonder Woman of JavaScript runtime environments. It's powerful, flexible, and always there when you need it. \n Next up, you'll need to install the Next.js CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, which will help you create your Next.js application with just a few simple commands. Think of the Next.js CLI tool as your personal butler who will do all the heavy lifting for you. \n Once you've got the Next.js CLI tool installed, it's time to create your first Next.js application. To do that, just open up your terminal and type the following command: \n | npx create-next-app my-awesome-app \n This will create a new Next.js application in a directory called 'my-awesome-app'. Now, use the following commands to navigate to that directory and start the development server: \n | cd my-awesome-app \n | npm run dev \n Okay, so now that we have a basic Next.js web application up and running, let's build a portfolio website to showcase all your amazing projects! But before we get started, let's take a moment to do a little victory dance. You've officially created your first Next.js web application! Go ahead and do a little moonwalk or a robot dance, I'll wait... \n  Alright, let's get back to business. The first thing we need to do is create some components that we can use to build our portfolio website. Components are reusable pieces of code that you can use to build your website. They're like lego blocks, but instead of building a castle, you're building a website! \n In Next.js, components are stored in the 'components' directory. To create a new component, just create a new file in that directory. For example, let's create a component called 'Header'. \n// components/Header.js \n  import React from 'react'\n const Header = () => { \n return ( \n <header> \n <h1>My Portfolio</h1> \n </header> \n )} \n export default Header \n In this example, we're importing React and creating a header component that simply displays a header with the text 'My Portfolio'. \n  Now that you've created your header component, let's move on to creating pages. Pages are the individual pages of your website, and they're what your users will actually see when they visit your site. \n To create a page in Next.js, you can create a new file in the pages directory with a .js extension. Let's create a home page for your portfolio website. \n // pages/index.js \n import React from 'react'; \n import Header from '../components/Header'; \n const Home = () => ( \n <div> \n <Header /> \n <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p> \n </div> \n ); \n export default Home; \n \n Awesome! Now that you've got your Next.js web application up and running, it's time to start building your portfolio website! \n First of all, let's talk about components in Next.js. Components are the building blocks of your web application, and they're essentially small, reusable pieces of code that you can use to create your pages. Think of components like lego blocks - they're small, but when you put them together, they can create something amazing! \n To create a component in Next.js, you can create a new file in the components directory with a .js extension. Let's create a header component for your portfolio website. \n  // components/Header.js \n import React from 'react'; \n const Header = () => ( \n    <header> \n     <h1>My Portfolio</h1> \n  </header> \n ); \n export default Header; \n In this example, we're importing React and creating a header component that simply displays a header with the text 'My Portfolio'. \n Now that you've created your header component, let's move on to creating pages. Pages are the individual pages of your website, and they're what your users will actually see when they visit your site. \n To create a page in Next.js, you can create a new file in the pages directory with a .js extension. Let's create a home page for your portfolio website. \n // pages/index.js \n import React from 'react'; \n import Header from '../components/Header'; \n const Home = () => ( \n  <div> \n   <Header /> \n  <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p> \n  </div> \n ); \n  export default Home; \n In this example, we're importing React and our header component, and creating a home page that displays the header and a simple welcome message. \n Now that you've got your header component and home page set up, you can start building the rest of your portfolio website. You can create additional components for things like your portfolio projects, your resume, and your contact information. You can also create additional pages for different sections of your site, like your portfolio, your resume, and your contact page. \n And that's it! You now have all the knowledge you need to create a beautiful portfolio website using Next.js. So get out there and start coding! Who knows, you might just become the next big thing in the web development world. ",

King takes the pendant to her queen and to make sure she wears it all the time king has to be with her all day, all night. He keeps watching her and making sure it works he keeps asking how are you feeling to her. Queen is unaware of what his agenda is keeps getting healthier and happier because she gets to have time with him. And seeing her this lively king starts falling in love with her again. So he goes back to the warlock and ask him is there any antidote for the poison in the pendant so it would not kill her. Warlock said to the king I have never put poison in that pendant, the poison was in your mind my king. I believe the queen was unhappy because he could not see you and spend more time with you. That is why I gave you chance to heal her even at the expense of you beheading my head.",

This is a good advantage because sometimes you just want to try out a package before installing them globally.\n Let’s try a couple:\n npx cowsay <text>\n This is what npx cowsay <text> command do.

      "body": "Most of the time we see many threads like: \n MongoDB vs Mysql vs Cassandra vs RethinkDB vs Redis which one should I choose?  \n It goes on and on and on. And yes there are a lot of them to choose from but why use a database based on just SQL or just NoSql? Both can come in handy in different situations. They both store our data just in different forms and models. \n SQL is more of an old soul and an old reliable that companies have been using for many years. It likes structuring and establishing relationships between your data so it looks neat and clean. \n NoSQL on the other hand uses nothing but SQL so data can be in many different forms and NoSQL not very good at relationships, either . \n So what is structured and non-structured actually mean in databases? I used a SQL based database for my e-commerce which was MySQL and since I used Laravel framework it was a given. And now I am using MongoDB for another project I am working on. But let’s just start with MySQL. \n When it comes to keeping data SQL store them in tabels. We create our database starting with tables like users_tables, products_tables. \n After that we create columns for the users table like 'name', 'surname', 'password' and for the products table 'product_name', 'product_price'.",

      "description": "How do I use mind maps as a programmer",
      "preview":"Brain is somewhat hard to comprehend. But we all know about memory. Memory is where we acquire, store and retrieve knowledge. And mind maps can help this process.",
      "body": "What is memory? \n Before we get into mind maps we need to understand how memory and memorising or learning works. Usually memory split into two categories implicit and explicit. \n 1) Implicit memory: Implicit memories form unconsciosly. It is mostly effective when we are learning motor skills like walking or riding a bike. \n Explicit memory: You can say we are in charge of explicit memory. As it comes to explicit long-term memory we pick the things goes in there like a loved one’s birthday or passwords. \n How do we learn? \n There are stages between learning and making it a memory. There is a learning method called memorising by association that super-learners use. A lof of the knowledge we are trying to acquire is related to the ones we are already have even in the most loose and tenuous way. \n  Back in high school we did this thing where we put a foreign word into a sentence instead of the one we use in our language. I didn’t realise we are memorising them by assosiation. \n Let me give you an example. Let’s say we are trying to learn French. And we just learned the word Bougie which means candle in French. \n We can put it in a sentence like “We lit the bougies because the lights went out” and now our minds can associate the word bougie with candle. \n We can memorise everything by just associating with things we already know. \n Association can be made in different ways. We can make it into a mind map and put related words or ideas. \n  Mind Maps \n You remember those scribbles we did when in class and you remember which class you did it in. If yes, then you can understand how we associate things. You can associate your drawing of a man in pain with being in Math class. And that is how mind maps works, too. \n Let me Illustrate: \n  If I want to learn the word 'Bougie'. I need some words for association. And in this example of a mind map of the word Bugie I put Lumiere in the center since already know him and I thought Bougie is written kinda like Boogie hence my first thought was the Boogie man and Boogie man comes at night and it gets spooky so we need to turn the lights on hence the candles. \n   This is a simple mind-map with only one branch. You can add multiple branches. Let your mind wander. Normally, bougie is the center of the mind-map which is the theme. And the branches represents the new ideas. And you should use images to associate with your ideas. Be as visual as possible. \n Mind Mapping as a Programmer \n  People usually use mind maps for coming up with new ideas, coming up with solutions for a problem, taking notes etc. As you can see you can use mind maps for basically anything. I started mind mapping method for learning new things and planning my career. Now I use it for programming, too. \n Let’s say I am starting a new website project but I need a draft first. Before I start to draw the design I need to know where all things are gonna go so I create a mind map with multiple branches. \n  Then I carve out the details for the website I can create a sketch then start to build. \n These types of mind maps can also come in handy when you come across a bug issue and trying to find solutions. You can put the problem in the center and brainstorm the solutions. It can help you see the issue in a whole different light. \n",

Although these names can be interpreted different in different kind of systems. Let’s not go so much into the terminology so as not to get confused.",
      "body": "In general system uses either a CLI (Command line interface) or GUI (Graphical user interface) depending on the task at hand. I am going to refer to Command line interface as shell from now on.\nToday GUI is getting more popular because graphical user interfaces getting more appealing, easy to learn and user-friendly than shell.\nThere was a time shell was more popular. Back when GUI wasn’t a thing, there were only command line. You would use to run all the commands you need and it hasn’t changed since.\nThe reason we still use shell because it hasn’t changed since 1960s. When you scripting or dealing with a bunch of servers you don’t want your interface to change much as it may affect your scripts.\nShell has other advantages, too. It works at a higher speed and with precision which is important for a developer like myself. Shell may look more plain and drab than a GUI but it gives you much more flexibility.",
